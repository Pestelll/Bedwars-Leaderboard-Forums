**BEDWARS LEADERBOARD FORUMS GEN**

This script is made for the hypixel forums. Essentially it's a recreation of REZA's bedwars forums lb generator.  
I've recreated the lb gen and made it better in my own sense of tracking new stat alts and etc, But I've removed that feature from this version of the code because it is pretty much useless for you guys to have.  
---------------------------------------  
You need the antisniper api key for the code to work | https://antisniper.net/  

go into the code and replace "API KEY HERE" with your api key then run the code  
the code should generate a .txt file with the leaderboard formats and everything already in order. The only thing you need to do after that is copy and paste all the things in the .txt and paste it into a hypixel forums post.  

the code **does not** generate a title do you have to make the title yourself.
